// todoController.test.ts

/**
 * todoService.test.t show the tests for the todo service functions using Jest.
 * Due to time constraints, I have not written tests for the todo controller functions.
 * However, to write tests for the controllers, I will test the following scenarios:
 * 
 * 1. getTodosController
 *    - Should return all todos successfully.
 *    - Should handle errors properly and return a 500 status code with an error message.
 *
 * 2. createTodoController
 *    - Should create a new todo successfully when valid data is provided.
 *    - Should return a 400 status code when title or description is missing.
 *    - Should handle errors properly and return a 500 status code with an error message.
 * 
 * 3. updateTodoController
 *    - Should update an existing todo successfully when valid data is provided.
 *    - Should return a 400 status code when title or description is missing.
 *    - Should return a 404 status code when the todo to update is not found.
 *    - Should handle errors properly and return a 500 status code with an error message.
 * 
 * 4. deleteTodoController
 *    - Should delete an existing todo successfully.
 *    - Should return a 404 status code when the todo to delete is not found.
 *    - Should handle errors properly and return a 500 status code with an error message.
 * 
 * In each test, I will:
 * - Mock the corresponding service function (e.g., getTodos, createTodo, updateTodo, deleteTodo).
 * - Mock the Request and Response objects from Express.
 * - Ensure the proper status codes and response messages are returned based on different scenarios.
